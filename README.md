# RANDOM-QUESTIONS-GENERATOR-
BASICALLY THIS IS MY SMALL PROJECT THAT I HAVE BUILD USING PYTHON LANGUAGE THAT GENERATES RANDOM QUESTIONS AND BASED ON YOU SOLUTION IT WILL DISPLAY YOUR SCORE. YOU CAN CHANGE ANSWERS AND QUSTIONS FROM THE CODE AND CAN ASK N AMOUNT OF QUESTIONS. 

I HAVE TAKEN INSPIRATION FROM KBC, I HAVE NOT BUILD UI FOR THIS CAUSE MY EXAMS ARE COMING ONCE I GET THE TIME I'LL MAKE SURE TO ADD THE UI AND INTERFACE.
